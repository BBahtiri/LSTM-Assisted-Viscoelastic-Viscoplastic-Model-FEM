# viscoelastic_viscoplastic_model

3d viscoelastic viscoplastic model depending on moisture content and nanoparticle volume fraction

The stress response of a nanoparticle/ epoxy system is decomposed into an equilibrium part and two viscous parts to capture 
the nonlinear and rate-depended behavior of the material. We introduce the nanoparticle dependency through an amplification factor, 
which is a function of fillersâ€™ volume fraction.
