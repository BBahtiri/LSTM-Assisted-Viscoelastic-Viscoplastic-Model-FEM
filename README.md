# viscoelastic_viscoplastic_model

3d viscoelastic viscoplastic model depending on moisture content and nanoparticle volume fraction

The stress response of a nanoparticle/ epoxy system is decomposed into an equilibrium part and two viscous parts to capture 
the nonlinear and rate-depended behavior of the material. We introduce the nanoparticle dependency through an amplification factor, 
which is a function of fillersâ€™ volume fraction.

Our model incorporates experimental characteristics by using a decomposition
of the material behavior into a viscoelastic and a viscoplastic part,
corresponding to the time-dependent response and to the irreversible molecular
chain sliding, respectively. We further decompose the viscoelastic stress
response into a hyperelastic network, capturing the equilibrium of the viscoelastic
response and a viscous network, capturing the rate-dependent nonequilibrium
response. The time-independent hyperelastic part of the stressstrain
behavior contains an elastic spring, which is associated to the entropy
change due to deformations while the time-dependent viscous network is
composed of an elastic spring and a viscous dashpot capturing the rate- and
temperature dependent behavior of the material at hand. Additionally, the
quasi-irreversible sliding of the molecular chains results in stress softening
in the material known as the Mullins effect, which is implemented within
our constitutive model.
