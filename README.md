# Viscoelastic-Viscoplastic damage model

In this work we take a classical approach to solving the equations governing quasi-static finite-strain compressible elasticity, with code based on ```step-44``` and the code ```Quasi_static_Finite_strain_Compressible_Elasticity``` from the code gallery. The formulation adopted here is an updated lagrangian formulation and run the model for cyclic loading-unloading conditions at 0 and 10% nanoparticle weight fraction and dry/saturated state.

The stress response of a nanoparticle/ epoxy system is decomposed into an equilibrium part and two viscous parts to capture 
the nonlinear and rate-depended behavior of the material. We introduce the nanoparticle dependency through an amplification factor, 
which is a function of fillersâ€™ weight fraction.

Our model incorporates experimental characteristics by using a decomposition
of the material behavior into a viscoelastic and a viscoplastic part,
corresponding to the time-dependent response and to the irreversible molecular
chain sliding, respectively. We further decompose the viscoelastic stress
response into a hyperelastic network, capturing the equilibrium of the viscoelastic
response and a viscous network, capturing the rate-dependent nonequilibrium
response. The time-independent hyperelastic part of the stressstrain
behavior contains an elastic spring, which is associated to the entropy
change due to deformations while the time-dependent viscous network is
composed of an elastic spring and a viscous dashpot capturing the rate- and
temperature dependent behavior of the material at hand. Additionally, the
quasi-irreversible sliding of the molecular chains results in stress softening
in the material known as the Mullins effect, which is implemented within
our constitutive model. The schematic structure of the model is presented in the picture below.

**Note: Functions "lstm_forward" are used to incorporate the pretrained Deep-Learning model. Use the options "set Switch to ML = Off" and "set At which timestep switch to ML ? = 2147483646" in the parameter file to exclude the Deep-Learning model and continue with the constitutive model.**

## Run the code
Compile it using the following commands and run in release mode
```
cmake -DDEAL_II_DIR=/path/to/deal.II .
make release
make
```
you can run it by typing
```
./vevp_ml_model
```
**Note: Create an "output" folder in the running directory before running.**

The parameter file is already in the current directory, and has the following options:
